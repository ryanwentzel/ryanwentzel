## Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I pastor a church in Southern California. I preach, teach, and write. I walk with others through some of lifeâ€™s most difficult experiences. 

I was a software engineer back in the day. I worked on [basespace](https://github.com/basespace) before leaving software for pastoral ministry.
